# JavaScript DOM Manipulation

## Introduction

This project focuses on JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, where you will learn how to interact with the web page's structure and content using JavaScript. The DOM is a powerful tool for web developers to dynamically update and modify web pages without requiring a full page reload.

In this project, you will work on various tasks that involve altering the appearance and behavior of elements on an HTML page. Each task is designed to teach you specific aspects of DOM manipulation, from selecting elements to making changes based on user interactions.

### Project Requirements

- **Allowed Editors:** You can use any text editors of your choice.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Your code will be interpreted on the Chrome browser (version 57.0 or later).
- **File Formatting:** All your code files should end with a new line.
- **README.md:** A mandatory README.md file with meaningful information about the content must be placed at the root folder of the project.
- **Code Style:** Your JavaScript code should adhere to the semistandard coding style.
- **No Usage of var:** You are not allowed to use the `var` keyword in your code.
- **Non-Reloading HTML:** HTML should not reload for each action; DOM manipulation, value updates, and data fetching should be handled seamlessly.

### Project Tasks

1. **0-script.js**
   - **Task:** Write a JavaScript script that updates the text color of the header element to red (#FF0000). You must use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.

2. **1-script.js**
   - **Task:** Write a JavaScript script that updates the text color of the header element to red (#FF0000) when the user clicks on the tag with id `red_header`.

3. **2-script.js**
   - **Task:** Write a JavaScript script that adds the class `red` to the header element when the user clicks on the tag with id `red_header`.

4. **3-script.js**
   - **Task:** Write a JavaScript script that toggles the class of the header element when the user clicks on the tag with id `toggle_header`. The header element must always have one class: `red` or `green`, never both at the same time and never empty.

5. **4-script.js**
   - **Task:** Write a JavaScript script that adds an `<li>` element to a list when the user clicks on the element with id `add_item`. The new element must be: `<li>Item</li>` and must be added to the `<ul>` element with class `my_list`.

6. **5-script.js**
   - **Task:** Write a JavaScript script that updates the text of the header element to "New Header!!!" when the user clicks on the element with id `update_header`.

7. **6-script.js**
   - **Task:** Write a JavaScript script that fetches the character name from the URL `https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/api/people/5/?format=json` and displays it in the HTML tag with id `character`. You must use the Fetch API.

8. **7-script.js**
   - **Task:** Write a JavaScript script that fetches and lists the titles of all movies from the URL `https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/api/films/?format=json`. All movie titles must be listed in the HTML `<ul>` element with id `list_movies`. You must use the Fetch API.

9. **8-script.js**
   - **Task:** Write a JavaScript script that fetches the translation of "hello" from `https://hellosalut.stefanbohacek.dev/?lang=fr` and displays it in the HTML element with id `hello`. Your script must work when imported from the `<head>` tag.
